{"name":"QMP","tagline":"QMP Message Passing Library","body":"### Lattice QCD Message Passing (QMP)\r\nThe QMP project is a national effort to provide a high performance message passing interface on various hardware platforms for Lattice QCD computing. This message passing interface aims to provide channel oriented communication end points to communication readers and writers with low latency and high bandwidth. QMP is tailored to the repetitive and predominantly nearest neighbor communication patterns of lattice QCD calculations.\r\nOne of striking features of this messaging system is to allow writers to directly deposit contents to preallocated memory buffers of readers without costly synchronization mechanisms, yet gated by the reader. An established communication channel allows a reader and a writer to operate asynchronously so that slightly different operation rates between a reader and a writer will not yield low performance. Most memory copies are eliminated in the messaging system to improve latency.\r\n\r\n## QMP Version 2\r\nQMP version 2 has been defined, and implementations are in use\r\n\r\nQMP-2-0-Introduction (also available as PDF) gives an overview of the concepts as well as documentation of the API.\r\n\r\nQMP-2 Changes describes most of the differences between the two versions, including clarifications of the existing API, additions to the API, and a few corrections to the API. This document also describes the proposed evolution of the existing implementations.\r\n\r\n## QMP Implementations\r\nThe sections below describing existing implementations of the first standardized version of QMP (version 2).\r\n\r\n* QMP C Implementation over MPICH:\r\nVersion (2.0) of QMP over MPICH is ready for downloading. The MPICH version has been tested using MPICH-CHP4, MPICH-SHMEM and MPICH-GM on the same platform.
